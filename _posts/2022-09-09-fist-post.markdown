This is my first post using this blog. I had one hosted on Medium, came with markdown limits. Although I haven't been active in Medium lately, I never stopped writing.

What I plan to write here? No plans yet. Mostly about software engineering, daily challenges, life updates or rants about everything.

We also have an [About][about] page! 

I have been searching for a better blogging platform with low hustle. This site uses [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] and hosted on [Github Pages][github-pages]

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

[jekyll-docs]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home
[jekyll-gh]:   https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll
[jekyll-talk]: https://talk.jekyllrb.com/
[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
